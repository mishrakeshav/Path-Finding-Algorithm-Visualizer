This is a fun project to learn algorithms and also visualize it for better understanding.  

## Installing / Getting started

First install all the requirements using the requirements and then run the files of the respective algorithm you want to visualize

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<ul>
  <li>Run the run.py file</li>
  <li>Press A to run the DFS Algorithm.</li>
  <li>Press S to run the DFS Algorithm.</li>
  <li>Press D to run the A* Algorithm.</li>
  <li>Press C to clear the screen.</li>
</ul>
