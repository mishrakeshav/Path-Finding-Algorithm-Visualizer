This is a fun project to learn algorithms and also visualize it for better understanding. Also to showcase my algorithmic skills.  

## Installing / Getting started

First install all the requirements using the requirements and then run the files of the respective algorithm you want to visualize

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Visualize any algorithm by running the respective files(astar.py). A GUI window will showup.
